Proposed Solution:

To address these challenges, we propose the following steps:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize statistical methods to summarize the dataset and visualize trends.

Visualization: Use charts (pie charts, bar graphs) to depict social media usage patterns, gender distribution, and time spent on social media.

Insights & Interpretation: Identify patterns such as which demographic groups use social media the most and how much time they spend daily.
